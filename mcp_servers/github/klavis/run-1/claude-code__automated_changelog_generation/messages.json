This feature is not mentioned anywhere in the official documentation, making it difficult for users to discover, use, or understand its full capabilities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### How I Discovered It\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI discovered this feature after running a subagent named `statusline-setup`. This agent automatically modified my user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` file, adding a `statusLine` object. This implies it's an intended, albeit undocumented, feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Observed Functionality\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the configuration and its effect on the CLI, the `statusline` feature appears to:\\\\\\\\n1.  Be configured in `settings.json` with a `type` of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n2.  Execute a shell `command` to generate the prompt's status line.\\\\\\\\n3.  Receive session data as a JSON object via standard input to the command. This JSON contains keys like `workspace.current_dir` and `model.display_name`.\\\\\\\\n4.  Allow for rich, dynamic prompts using tools like `jq` to parse the session data and `echo` with ANSI codes for color.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### My Configuration Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere is the configuration that was added to my `settings.json` file by the `statusline-setup` agent:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"statusLine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input=$(cat); echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[1;32m\\\\\\\\u279c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[36m$(echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir' | sed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"s|^$HOME|~|\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | sed 's|.*/||')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[90m[$(echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | jq -r '.model.display_name')]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis produced a fantastic, context-aware prompt showing my current directory and active model, which is a great user experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Request\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCould you please add official documentation for the `statusline` feature?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdeally, the documentation would cover:\\\\\\\\n*   **Purpose and Scope:** A high-level explanation of what the `statusline` feature is for.\\\\\\\\n*   **Configuration:** The structure of the `statusLine` object in `settings.json`.\\\\\\\\n*   **Input Schema:** The full JSON schema of the data that is piped to the command. Knowing all available fields is crucial for customization.\\\\\\\\n*   **Examples:** A few examples ranging from a simple static prompt to a more advanced, dynamic one like the one above.\\\\\\\\n*   **Feature Status:** Clarification on whether this feature is considered stable, beta, or experimental.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is a fantastic addition for power users who want to customize their CLI experience. Documenting it would allow the wider community to benefit from it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThank you for building such a great tool\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Task color proposal - orange/ginger instead of blue.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"labels\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311149920,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzfYA\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"a2eeef\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"New feature or request\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311150179,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzgYw\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null}],\\\\\\\"closed_at\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2025-09-19T03:33:04Z\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\":27,\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"It's standard - orange=in progress.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Missing Tool Result Block for Tool Use ID toolu_01GUUUdR6TqtrqKTprMSuLqc\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"labels\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311149910,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzfVg\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/bug\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"bug\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"d73a4a\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Something isn't working\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311149919,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzfXw\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/duplicate\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"duplicate\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"cfd3d7\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"This issue or pull request already exists\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311150035,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzf0w\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/area:core\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"area:core\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311150042,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzf2g\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/platform:macos\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"platform:macos\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9311150043,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPywOcs8AAAACKvzf2w\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/area:api\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"area:api\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null}],\\\\\\\"closed_at\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2025-09-19T03:33:00Z\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\":25,\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"**Bug Description**\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\u23bf \\\\\\\\u00a0API Error: 400 {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"invalid_request_error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"messages.6: `tool_use` ids were found without `tool_result` blocks immediately after: \\\\\\\\n     toolu_01GUUUdR6TqtrqKTprMSuLqc.

You're absolutely right - my Grep search should have found it. Let me try the Grep tool again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n?

That's strange - the Grep tool is not finding matches that the bash find command clearly found. Let me try a simpler pattern:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n?

The Grep tool seems to be having issues finding patterns that clearly exist. This explains why my earlier searches failed - there appears to be a problem with the Grep tool's search functionality. The bash find command successfully found the files containing\\\\\\\\n  _get_file_name_from_content in:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. ./api_server/test_autogen_utils.py\\\\\\\\n  2.

The issue manifests as API request timeouts, malformed requests due to ANSI escape sequence contamination, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Shell Integration Unavailable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" errors.

PR introduces a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate the Docker image build process. This workflow is configured to automatically trigger whenever the branch is updated, ensuring that a fresh Docker image is built for the latest code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Key Changes:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Added GitHub Actions Workflow:** A new workflow file (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` or similar) has been added.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Leverages GitHub Action Templates:** The workflow is based on existing GitHub Action templates for Docker image building, ensuring best practices and ease of maintenance.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Automated Trigger:** The workflow is set to run automatically on `push` events to the branch, providing continuous integration for Docker image creation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Benefits:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Continuous Integration:** Ensures that a Docker image is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Improved Reliability:** Catches build issues early in the development cycle.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Reduced Manual Effort:** Eliminates the need for manual Docker image builds.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Faster Feedback Loop:** Developers get immediate feedback on the Docker build status of their changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**How to Test:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPush a new commit to this branch, and observe the GitHub Actions tab to confirm the workflow is triggered and completes
