This feature is not mentioned anywhere in the official documentation, making it difficult for users to discover, use, or understand its full capabilities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### How I Discovered It\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI discovered this feature after running a subagent named `statusline-setup`. This agent automatically modified my user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` file, adding a `statusLine` object. This implies it's an intended, albeit undocumented, feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Observed Functionality\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the configuration and its effect on the CLI, the `statusline` feature appears to:\\\\\\\\n1.  Be configured in `settings.json` with a `type` of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n2.  Execute a shell `command` to generate the prompt's status line.\\\\\\\\n3.  Receive session data as a JSON object via standard input to the command. This JSON contains keys like `workspace.current_dir` and `model.display_name`.\\\\\\\\n4.  Allow for rich, dynamic prompts using tools like `jq` to parse the session data and `echo` with ANSI codes for color.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### My Configuration Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere is the configuration that was added to my `settings.json` file by the `statusline-setup` agent:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"statusLine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"command\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input=$(cat); echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[1;32m\\\\\\\\u279c\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[36m$(echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir' | sed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"s|^$HOME|~|\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | sed 's|.*/||')\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[90m[$(echo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | jq -r '.model.display_name')]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\033[0m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis produced a fantastic, context-aware prompt showing my current directory and active model, which is a great user experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Request\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCould you please add official documentation for the `statusline` feature?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdeally, the documentation would cover:\\\\\\\\n*   **Purpose and Scope:** A high-level explanation of what the `statusline` feature is for.\\\\\\\\n*   **Configuration:** The structure of the `statusLine` object in `settings.json`.\\\\\\\\n*   **Input Schema:** The full JSON schema of the data that is piped to the command. Knowing all available fields is crucial for customization.\\\\\\\\n*   **Examples:** A few examples ranging from a simple static prompt to a more advanced, dynamic one like the one above.\\\\\\\\n*   **Feature Status:** Clarification on whether this feature is considered stable, beta, or experimental.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is a fantastic addition for power users who want to customize their CLI experience. Documenting it would allow the wider community to benefit from it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThank you for building such a great tool\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\":30,\\\\\\\"labels\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304763626,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKpts6g\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0075ca\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Improvements or additions to documentation\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304764035,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKptugw\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null}],\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"closed_at\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2025-09-18T04:32:49Z\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"[Docs] Undocumented `statusline` configuration feature\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"It's standard - orange=in progress.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\":27,\\\\\\\"labels\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304763640,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKpts-A\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"a2eeef\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"New feature or request\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304764035,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKptugw\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"area:tui\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ededed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":false,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":null}],\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"closed_at\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2025-09-18T04:32:45Z\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Task color proposal - orange/ginger instead of blue.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"**Bug Description**\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\u23bf \\\\\\\\u00a0API Error: 400 {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"invalid_request_error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"messages.6: `tool_use` ids were found without `tool_result` blocks immediately after: \\\\\\\\n     toolu_01GUUUdR6TqtrqKTprMSuLqc.

\\\\\\\\u2022 Customizable status line: add your terminal prompt to Claude Code with /statusline\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI couldn't understand what `/statusline` would do. I asked Claude Code and it provided this useful information. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> The /statusline command customizes the status bar at the bottom of your Claude Code interface. It lets you display useful information like:\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n>   - Current working directory\\\\\\\\n>   - Git branch and status\\\\\\\\n>   - Active model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, etc.)\\\\\\\\n>   - Project context\\\\\\\\n>   - Custom text or emojis\\\\\\\\n>   - System info (time, date, etc.)\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n>   Think of it like customizing your terminal prompt (PS1), but for Claude Code's interface. You can configure what information appears and how it's formatted.\\\\\\\\n> \\\\\\\\n>   For example, a statusLine might show:\\\\\\\\n>   \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\udcc1 /Users/XXXX/YYYY/Sample.API | \\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\udf3f Test/sample-features | \\\\\\\\ud83e\\\\\\\\udd16 Opus 4.1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt would be really helpful to have an abridged version of the information (in block quotes) as part of the release notes.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"number\\\\\\\":23,\\\\\\\"labels\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304763626,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKpts6g\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0075ca\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Improvements or additions to documentation\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":9304763640,\\\\\\\"node_id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"LA_kwDOPyFuxs8AAAACKpts-A\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code/labels/enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"enhancement\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"a2eeef\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"New feature or request\\\\\\\"}],\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"closed\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"closed_at\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2025-09-18T04:32:39Z\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"[Documentation] Claude Code release notes for v1.0.71 is not informative.

You're absolutely right - my searches were failing because I was searching the entire codebase rather than focusing on the specific file you mentioned. Let me check that file directly:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n? Read(api_server/autogen_executor.py)\\\\\\\\n  ? \\\\\\\\u00a0Read 1784 lines (ctrl+r to expand)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n? Now I can see the _get_file_name_from_content function! It's at line 544. Let me look at that function more closely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n?

That's strange - the Grep tool is not finding matches that the bash find command clearly found. Let me try a simpler pattern:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n?

The Grep tool seems to be having issues finding patterns that clearly exist. This explains why my earlier searches failed - there appears to be a problem with the Grep tool's search functionality. The bash find command successfully found the files containing\\\\\\\\n  _get_file_name_from_content in:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. ./api_server/test_autogen_utils.py\\\\\\\\n  2.

The issue manifests as API request timeouts, malformed requests due to ANSI escape sequence contamination, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Shell Integration Unavailable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" errors. This affects all Claude Code operations and renders the tool unusable without disabling PowerLevel10k features.\\\\\\\\nNote: PowerLevel10k currently has limited support status with the project maintainer stating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"THE PROJECT HAS VERY LIMITED SUPPORT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as of 2025, but remains widely deployed in existing development environments.\\\\\\\\nSteps to Reproduce\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstall PowerLevel10k Zsh theme with default configuration (instant prompt enabled)\\\\\\\\nOpen terminal with Zsh + PowerLevel10k active\\\\\\\\nNavigate to any project directory\\\\\\\\nRun any Claude Code command (e.g., claude \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"help me debug this code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nObserve timeout errors and failed API communication\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlternative reproduction:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstall PowerLevel10k with: git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k\\\\\\\\nSet ZSH_THEME=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in .zshrc\\\\\\\\nEnsure instant prompt is enabled (default behavior)\\\\\\\\nRestart terminal and attempt Claude Code operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpected Behavior\\\\\\\\nClaude Code should function normally regardless of terminal theme choice, successfully:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAuthenticating with Anthropic API\\\\\\\\nParsing terminal output for context\\\\\\\\nExecuting commands and receiving responses\\\\\\\\nMaintaining shell integration in VSCode terminals\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nActual Behavior\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTimeout Errors: API requests consistently timeout during communication\\\\\\\\nParsing Failures: Terminal output parsing fails due to ANSI escape sequence contamination\\\\\\\\nShell Integration Failures: VSCode terminals show \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Shell Integration Unavailable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" errors\\\\\\\\nMalformed Requests: API requests contain corrupted data with escape sequences like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x1B[31m or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x07\\\\\\\\nHanging Operations: Commands appear to execute but Claude Code hangs indefinitely waiting for clean output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditional Context\\\\\\\\nScope of Issue\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAffected Users: Anyone using PowerLevel10k (50K+ GitHub stars, though project has limited support as of 2025)\\\\\\\\nSystem-wide Impact: Affects all terminals, not limited to VSCode integration\\\\\\\\nReproducibility: 100% consistent across different systems and configurations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTechnical Root Cause\\\\\\\\nPowerLevel10k's instant prompt feature redirects stdin/stdout during shell initialization and injects ANSI escape sequences into terminal output streams. This conflicts with VSCode's Terminal Shell Integration API (introduced in VSCode 1.93, August 2024) that modern AI coding tools rely on for terminal communication.\\\\\\\\nEcosystem Evidence\\\\\\\\nThis same issue affects other AI CLI tools across the development ecosystem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCursor AI: Commands hang with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Running terminal command...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nCline Project: Officially recommends removing PowerLevel10k in troubleshooting guides\\\\\\\\nClaude Coder (Kodu AI): Lists PowerLevel10k as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"common culprit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for terminal issues\\\\\\\\nVS Code Copilot Agent: Similar terminal hanging issues documented\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProven Solutions Available\\\\\\\\nThe JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem has established solutions for this exact problem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nstrip-ansi package (9,577 dependent packages) - industry standard for ANSI code removal\\\\\\\\nNode.js built-in util.stripVTControlCharacters() (available since v16.11.0) - zero-dependency solution\\\\\\\\nchalk package (127,433 dependent packages) - demonstrates terminal capability detection patterns\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWorkarounds (Temporary)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDisable instant prompt: typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off\\\\\\\\nSwitch to simpler terminal themes or Starship (modern alternative)\\\\\\\\nUse environment-specific configurations that detect AI tools\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAttached Technical Analysis\\\\\\\\nA comprehensive technical report (attached as .md file) details the root cause, provides ecosystem evidence, and outlines specific implementation solutions based on proven approaches from the JavaScript CLI ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nRequest: Implement automatic ANSI escape sequence stripping for terminal output parsing, similar to how other Node.js CLI tools handle this compatibility challenge.

This workflow is configured to automatically trigger whenever the branch is updated, ensuring that a fresh Docker image is built for the latest code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Key Changes:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Added GitHub Actions Workflow:** A new workflow file (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` or similar) has been added.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Leverages GitHub Action Templates:** The workflow is based on existing GitHub Action templates for Docker image building, ensuring best practices and ease of maintenance.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Automated Trigger:** The workflow is set to run automatically on `push` events to the branch, providing continuous integration for Docker image creation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Benefits:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Continuous Integration:** Ensures that a Docker image is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Improved Reliability:** Catches build issues early in the development cycle.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Reduced Manual Effort:** Eliminates the need for manual Docker image builds.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Faster Feedback Loop:** Developers get immediate feedback on the Docker build status of their changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**How to Test:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPush a new commit to this branch, and observe the GitHub Actions tab to confirm the workflow is triggered and completes
