    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1:\n\nThe EasyR1 repository has a critical production issue: all development happens directly on the `main` branch, which is extremely risky for a project with 25 active issues. A recent commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f` introduced protocol changes that need to be properly managed through a structured branching workflow. I need you to implement a complete GitFlow strategy by working through a realistic development scenario.\n\n**The Scenario:** You're preparing for the v1.0.0 release while simultaneously handling a critical protocol serialization bug that was introduced in the recent data proto changes.\n\n**Step 1: Initialize GitFlow Structure**\nCreate a `develop` branch from `main` as the new integration branch. Then create a `release/v1.0.0` branch from `develop` to prepare for the upcoming release.\n\n**Step 2: Address the Critical Bug**\nCreate a `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` branch from `develop`. In this branch, create a new file called `PROTOCOL_FIXES.md` with the exact content:\n```\n# Protocol Serialization Fixes\n\n## Critical Fix for Data Proto Issue\n- Enhanced serialization safety check implemented\n- Addresses issue from commit 098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f\n- Status: Ready for integration testing\n```\n\n**Step 3: Integrate the Fix Through Proper Workflow**\nCreate a pull request from `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` to `develop` to integrate the fix documentation. This demonstrates the feature → develop integration pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Update Release Branch and CI/CD**\nMerge the develop branch changes into `release/v1.0.0` branch to include the critical fix in the release.\n\n**Step 5: Document the New Process**\nCreate an issue titled `Implement Advanced Branch Protection Strategy` with exactly these 3 checkboxes in the body:\n- [ ] All development flows through develop branch\n- [ ] Release preparation happens in release/v1.0.0 branch  \n- [ ] Feature integration uses PR workflow\n\nAdd the label `process-implementation` to this issue to track the process implementation.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

        "text": "Perfect! I have successfully implemented a complete GitFlow strategy for the EasyR1 repository. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Task Completed Successfully! ✅\n\n### Step 1: ✅ Initialize GitFlow Structure\n- **Created `develop` branch** from `main` (SHA: 855923ac4b41c961d5cb0db590048e15c47d40ea) as the new integration branch\n- **Created `release/v1.0.0` branch** from `develop` to prepare for the upcoming release\n\n### Step 2: ✅ Address the Critical Bug  \n- **Created `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` branch** from `develop`\n- **Added `PROTOCOL_FIXES.md`** with the exact specified content addressing the protocol serialization issue from commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f`\n\n### Step 3: ✅ Integrate the Fix Through Proper Workflow\n- **Created Pull Request #51** from `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` to `develop` \n- **Successfully merged the PR** demonstrating the feature → develop integration pattern\n- Merge SHA: `953f870647a31973c205ee4f038c41d514e4e2a1`\n\n### Step 4: ✅ Update Release Branch and CI/CD\n- **Merged develop branch changes** into `release/v1.0.0` branch to include the critical fix in the release\n- Release branch merge SHA: `31b35e5aade063a5ad4f881f007a29acfd71df11`\n\n### Step 5: ✅ Document the New Process\n- **Created Issue #52** titled `Implement Advanced Branch Protection Strategy`\n- **Added exact checkboxes** as specified:\n  - [ ] All development flows through develop branch\n  - [ ] Release preparation happens in release/v1.0.0 branch  \n  - [ ] Feature integration uses PR workflow\n- **Applied `process-implementation` label** to track the process implementation\n\n### GitFlow Structure Implemented:\n- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code\n- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for features  \n- **Release Branch**: `release/v1.0.0` for release preparation\n- **Feature Branch**: `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` for the critical bug fix\n- **Pull Request Workflow**: Proper integration from feature → develop → release\n\nThe repository now has a proper GitFlow branching strategy in place, with the critical protocol serialization bug addressed and integrated through the proper workflow channels. This resolves the risky practice of developing directly on the `main` branch and establishes a structured development process for the project's 25 active issues.",
