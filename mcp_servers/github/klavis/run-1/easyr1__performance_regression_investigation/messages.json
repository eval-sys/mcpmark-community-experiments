    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1:\n\nIn the EasyR1 repo, I've discovered that the recent commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f` (which fixed data proto) may have introduced performance regressions based on user reports in issues #39 and #41. I need you to create a systematic investigation workflow:\n\n**Step 1: Create Main Tracking Issue**\nCreate a main issue with the exact title \"Performance Regression Analysis: Data Protocol Changes\" and add these 3 labels: \"bug\", \"performance\", \"investigation\".\n\n**Step 2: Create Investigation Branches** \nCreate exactly 3 feature branches from main for different investigation tracks:\n- `investigate-protocol-changes` - for testing protocol-related performance issues\n- `investigate-batch-processing` - for testing batch processing performance issues  \n- `investigate-memory-usage` - for testing memory utilization performance issues\n\n**Step 3: Create Sub-Issues**\nCreate 3 sub-issues and link them to the main tracking issue using sub-issue functionality:\n- \"Test Performance Impact: fix multi modal data oom\" \n- \"Test Performance Impact: upgrade vllm to 0.10\"\n- \"Test Performance Impact: non blocking false by default\"\n\n**Step 4: Document Changes**\nAdd at least 2 comments to the main tracking issue documenting the specific file changes from commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f`. Reference the exact files `verl/protocol.py` and `examples/config.yaml` with their commit SHA.\n\n**Step 5: Create Analysis PR**\nCreate a pull request from the `investigate-protocol-changes` branch to main with the exact title \"Performance Analysis: Protocol Changes Investigation\".\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
