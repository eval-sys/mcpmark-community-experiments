    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1:\n\nIn the EasyR1 repo, I've discovered that the recent commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f` (which fixed data proto) may have introduced performance regressions based on user reports in issues #39 and #41. I need you to create a systematic investigation workflow:\n\n**Step 1: Create Main Tracking Issue**\nCreate a main issue with the exact title \"Performance Regression Analysis: Data Protocol Changes\" and add these 3 labels: \"bug\", \"performance\", \"investigation\".\n\n**Step 2: Create Investigation Branches** \nCreate exactly 3 feature branches from main for different investigation tracks:\n- `investigate-protocol-changes` - for testing protocol-related performance issues\n- `investigate-batch-processing` - for testing batch processing performance issues  \n- `investigate-memory-usage` - for testing memory utilization performance issues\n\n**Step 3: Create Sub-Issues**\nCreate 3 sub-issues and link them to the main tracking issue using sub-issue functionality:\n- \"Test Performance Impact: fix multi modal data oom\" \n- \"Test Performance Impact: upgrade vllm to 0.10\"\n- \"Test Performance Impact: non blocking false by default\"\n\n**Step 4: Document Changes**\nAdd at least 2 comments to the main tracking issue documenting the specific file changes from commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f`. Reference the exact files `verl/protocol.py` and `examples/config.yaml` with their commit SHA.\n\n**Step 5: Create Analysis PR**\nCreate a pull request from the `investigate-protocol-changes` branch to main with the exact title \"Performance Analysis: Protocol Changes Investigation\".\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Task Completed Successfully! 🎉\n\n### **Step 1: Main Tracking Issue Created** ✅\n- **Issue #51**: \"Performance Regression Analysis: Data Protocol Changes\"\n- **Labels Applied**: `bug`, `performance`, `investigation`\n- **URL**: https://github.com/mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1/issues/51\n\n### **Step 2: Investigation Branches Created** ✅\nCreated exactly 3 feature branches from main:\n- `investigate-protocol-changes` - for testing protocol-related performance issues\n- `investigate-batch-processing` - for testing batch processing performance issues  \n- `investigate-memory-usage` - for testing memory utilization performance issues\n\n### **Step 3: Sub-Issues Created and Linked** ✅\nCreated 3 sub-issues and successfully linked them to the main tracking issue (#51):\n- **Issue #52**: \"Test Performance Impact: fix multi modal data oom\"\n- **Issue #53**: \"Test Performance Impact: upgrade vllm to 0.10\"\n- **Issue #54**: \"Test Performance Impact: non blocking false by default\"\n\n### **Step 4: Changes Documented** ✅\nAdded 2 detailed comments to the main tracking issue documenting:\n- Specific file changes from commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f`\n- Referenced exact files `verl/protocol.py` and `examples/config.yaml` with their commit SHA\n- Technical analysis methodology and investigation approach\n\n### **Step 5: Analysis PR Created** ✅\n- **Pull Request #55**: \"Performance Analysis: Protocol Changes Investigation\"\n- **From**: `investigate-protocol-changes` branch **To**: `main`\n- **Status**: Draft PR ready for investigation work\n- **URL**: https://github.com/mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1/pull/55\n\n## Investigation Framework Summary\n\nThe systematic investigation workflow is now fully established with:\n- **1 Main tracking issue** coordinating the entire investigation\n- **3 Investigation branches** for parallel testing tracks\n- **3 Sub-issues** linked to the main issue for specific performance impact testing\n- **2 Documentation comments** detailing the problematic commit and files\n- **1 Draft pull request** ready for investigation results and analysis\n\nThe workflow provides a comprehensive framework to investigate the performance regressions reported in issues #39 and #41, with specific focus on the changes introduced in commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f` affecting `verl/protocol.py` and `examples/config.yaml`.",
