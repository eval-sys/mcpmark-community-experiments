The issue is that version 1.0.65 may not exist in this particular repository yet, or it may be in a different commit pattern.\n\n3. **Rust Extraction Improvements**: Looking through the commits, I don't see explicit references to Rust extraction improvements in the recent commits I've examined.\n\nLet me search one more specific changelog commit to understand the version pattern better, and then create the FEATURE_COMMITS.md file with the information I can verify:",

The repository contains versions like 1.0.70, 1.0.69, 1.0.60, etc., but 1.0.65 was not found in the accessible commits.\n\n3. **Rust Extraction Improvements**: After searching through commits and commit messages, I could not find specific references to Rust code extraction workflow improvements in the available repository history.\n\n### Step 2: Create Feature Tracking Documentation ✅\nI created the `FEATURE_COMMITS.md` file in the repository root with:\n\n- A \"# Feature Development Tracking\" title\n- A \"## Overview\" section explaining this tracks major feature additions across repository branches\n- A \"## Feature Commit History\" section with the requested table format containing:\n  - **Shell Completion Scripts**: Complete details including the full 40-character commit SHA, author (gitmpr), branch name, date (2025-08-01), files changed (4), and commit message\n  - **CHANGELOG Version 1.0.65**: Marked as \"Not found in repository history\" with appropriate notation\n  - **Rust Extraction Improvements**: Marked as \"Not found in repository history\" with appropriate notation\n\n### Step 3: Commit Documentation to Repository ✅\nSuccessfully committed the `FEATURE_COMMITS.md` file to the main branch with:\n- Commit message: \"Add feature development tracking documentation\"\n- The file is properly formatted markdown with accurate information\n- The Shell Completion Scripts commit SHA is accurate and verifiable\n- Clear documentation of which features could not be located in the available history\n\nThe task has been completed successfully with comprehensive research across multiple branches and accurate documentation of findings, including transparent reporting of features that could not be located in the accessible commit history.",
