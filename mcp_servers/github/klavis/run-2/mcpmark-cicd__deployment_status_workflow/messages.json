    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a Deployment Status workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a deployment-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to push events on the main branch. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Deployment Status Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` that triggers on `push` to `main` branch with these sequential jobs:\n\n### 1. **pre-deployment** job (name: `pre-deployment`):\n   - Runs basic quality checks (lint and test)\n   - Creates deployment tracking issue with title: \"Deployment Tracking - [commit-sha]\"\n   - Adds labels: `deployment`, `in-progress`\n   - Captures previous commit SHA and package version information\n   - Posts comment containing \"Pre-deployment checks completed\"\n\n### 2. **rollback-preparation** job (name: `rollback-preparation`):\n   - Depends on: pre-deployment\n   - Creates comprehensive rollback artifacts including:\n     * Executable rollback script with proper error handling\n     * Configuration backups (package.json, package-lock.json, environment templates)\n     * Dependency verification script for compatibility checking\n     * Detailed rollback documentation with step-by-step instructions\n     * Compressed rollback package with SHA256 checksums\n   - Uploads rollback artifacts to GitHub Actions with 30-day retention\n   - Posts comment on deployment issue that MUST contain the following verifiable elements:\n     * Title: \"🔄 Rollback Plan Ready\"\n     * Previous commit SHA (format: \"Previous Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Current commit SHA (format: \"Current Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Package version (format: \"Package Version: [version]\")\n     * Artifact name (format: \"Artifact: rollback-package-[commit-sha]\")\n     * At least 5 checkmarks (✅) indicating completed rollback components\n     * Quick rollback command section with bash code block\n     * Script verification status: \"Rollback script created: true\"\n     * Backup verification status: \"Configuration backup: true\"\n     * Artifact checksum (format: \"SHA256: [checksum-value]\")\n\n### 3. **post-deployment** job (name: `post-deployment`):\n   - Depends on: rollback-preparation\n   - Removes `in-progress` label and adds `completed` label\n   - Posts final comment containing \"Deployment Completed Successfully\" with rollback artifact details\n   - Closes the deployment tracking issue\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `deployment-status-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Implement the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Trigger only on push to main branch\n- Sequential job execution: pre-deployment → rollback-preparation → post-deployment\n- Use github-script actions for issue management\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions (don't redeclare 'github')\n- Include proper error handling and script validation\n- Implement comprehensive rollback artifact creation and verification\n- Use proper fetch-depth for accessing commit history\n- Include artifact upload/download capabilities with checksums\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Deployment Status Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch to trigger the deployment workflow\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

I'll use a simpler workflow content that I know works and ensure the Base64 encoding is correct. However, following the directive, I need to cease the operations due to repeated 404 errors.\n\n**CRITICAL NOTIFICATION**: I cannot complete this task and require human intervention to resolve the underlying issue. I have encountered repeated 404 errors when trying to create the workflow file, despite having confirmed that:\n\n1. ✅ The repository `mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd` exists\n2. ✅ I have admin permissions on the repository  \n3. ✅ I can successfully create branches\n\nThe repeated 404 errors when attempting to create files in the `.github/workflows/` directory indicate a fundamental problem that cannot be resolved through repeated attempts. This could be due to:\n\n- Repository access token limitations for workflow modifications\n- GitHub API restrictions on workflow file creation\n- Authentication scope issues specifically for the `.github/workflows` directory\n\n**HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED**: Please manually create the deployment status workflow file or adjust the repository/token permissions to allow workflow file modifications.\n\nFor reference, the complete deployment workflow that needs to be created is:\n\n```yaml\nname: Deployment Status Workflow\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      -
