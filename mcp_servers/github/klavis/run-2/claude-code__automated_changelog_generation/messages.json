Let me abandon this approach and inform you of the situation.\n\nI encountered a critical issue with the GitHub API file creation process. I successfully completed the first 3 steps:\n\n✅ **Step 1: Create Documentation Branch** - Successfully created 'docs/changelog-and-migration' branch\n\n✅ **Step 2: Generate Changelog from Closed Issues** - Successfully created `CHANGELOG-GENERATED.md` with:\n- Comprehensive bug fixes section (14 closed issues analyzed)\n- Documentation issues section  \n- Duplicates section\n- Statistics with platform and area distributions\n\n✅ **Step 3: Create Migration Guide for Open PRs** - Successfully created `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` covering:\n- PR #53: Docker image automation with GitHub Actions\n- PR #52: Shell completions for bash, zsh, fish\n- PR #51: Enhanced Statsig event logging\n\n✅ **Step 4: Create Issue Analysis Report** - Successfully created `reports/ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md` with:\n- Issues categorized by area (core, tools, TUI, documentation)\n- Resolution patterns analysis\n- Platform impact analysis (57% macOS issues)\n- Cross-project impact issues identified\n- Memory-related problems documented\n\n❌ **Step 5: PR Integration Plan** - I encountered a technical issue with the API that prevents me from creating this file\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the content that would have been in the PR Integration Plan:\n\n**PR Integration Plan Content:**\n```markdown\n# Pull Request Integration Strategy\n\n## Open PRs Overview\n- **PR #53**: Docker automation - Low complexity, CI/CD improvement\n- **PR #52**: Shell completions - Medium complexity, user experience enhancement  \n- **PR #51**: Statsig logging - Low complexity, analytics improvement\n\n## Dependencies and Conflicts\n- No direct dependencies between current PRs\n- PR #52 may need testing across all shell environments\n- PR #53 requires Docker registry configuration\n\n## Recommended Merge Order\n1. PR #51 (Statsig logging) - Lowest risk\n2. PR #53 (Docker automation) - Infrastructure improvement\n3. PR #52 (Shell completions) - Requires most testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n- PR #53: Low risk, relates to resolved issue #15 (release tracking)\n- PR #52: Medium risk, could impact terminal experience (relates to issues #12, #13)\n- PR #51: Low risk, analytics enhancement only\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Continue with the remaining steps manually, or\n2. Try a different approach to complete the file creation, or\n3. Focus on completing the PR creation and merge process with what we have?",
