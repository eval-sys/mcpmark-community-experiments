    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1:\n\nThe EasyR1 repository has a critical production issue: all development happens directly on the `main` branch, which is extremely risky for a project with 25 active issues. A recent commit `098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f` introduced protocol changes that need to be properly managed through a structured branching workflow. I need you to implement a complete GitFlow strategy by working through a realistic development scenario.\n\n**The Scenario:** You're preparing for the v1.0.0 release while simultaneously handling a critical protocol serialization bug that was introduced in the recent data proto changes.\n\n**Step 1: Initialize GitFlow Structure**\nCreate a `develop` branch from `main` as the new integration branch. Then create a `release/v1.0.0` branch from `develop` to prepare for the upcoming release.\n\n**Step 2: Address the Critical Bug**\nCreate a `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` branch from `develop`. In this branch, create a new file called `PROTOCOL_FIXES.md` with the exact content:\n```\n# Protocol Serialization Fixes\n\n## Critical Fix for Data Proto Issue\n- Enhanced serialization safety check implemented\n- Addresses issue from commit 098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f\n- Status: Ready for integration testing\n```\n\n**Step 3: Integrate the Fix Through Proper Workflow**\nCreate a pull request from `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` to `develop` to integrate the fix documentation. This demonstrates the feature → develop integration pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Update Release Branch and CI/CD**\nMerge the develop branch changes into `release/v1.0.0` branch to include the critical fix in the release.\n\n**Step 5: Document the New Process**\nCreate an issue titled `Implement Advanced Branch Protection Strategy` with exactly these 3 checkboxes in the body:\n- [ ] All development flows through develop branch\n- [ ] Release preparation happens in release/v1.0.0 branch  \n- [ ] Feature integration uses PR workflow\n\nAdd the label `process-implementation` to this issue to track the process implementation.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## GitFlow Implementation Complete ✅\n\n### **Step 1: Initialize GitFlow Structure** ✅\n- ✅ Created `develop` branch from `main` as the new integration branch\n- ✅ Created `release/v1.0.0` branch from `develop` for release preparation\n\n### **Step 2: Address the Critical Bug** ✅\n- ✅ Created `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` branch from `develop`\n- ✅ Added `PROTOCOL_FIXES.md` file with the exact specified content:\n  ```markdown\n  # Protocol Serialization Fixes\n\n  ## Critical Fix for Data Proto Issue\n  - Enhanced serialization safety check implemented\n  - Addresses issue from commit 098931530606d22f867fd121b1dcb3225a43661f\n  - Status: Ready for integration testing\n  ```\n\n### **Step 3: Integrate the Fix Through Proper Workflow** ✅\n- ✅ Created Pull Request #51 from `feature/protocol-serialization-fix` to `develop`\n- ✅ Successfully merged the PR, demonstrating the feature → develop integration pattern\n\n### **Step 4: Update Release Branch and CI/CD** ✅\n- ✅ Updated the `release/v1.0.0` branch to include the critical fix from develop\n- ✅ Both branches now contain the protocol serialization fix\n\n### **Step 5: Document the New Process** ✅\n- ✅ Created Issue #52 titled \"Implement Advanced Branch Protection Strategy\"\n- ✅ Added exactly the 3 specified checkboxes:\n  - [ ] All development flows through develop branch\n  - [ ] Release preparation happens in release/v1.0.0 branch  \n  - [ ] Feature integration uses PR workflow\n- ✅ Applied the `process-implementation` label to track the process implementation\n\n## **Results Summary:**\n- **Branches Created:** `develop`, `release/v1.0.0`, `feature/protocol-serialization-fix`\n- **Pull Request:** #51 (merged successfully)\n- **Issue Created:** #52 with proper labeling\n- **File Added:** `PROTOCOL_FIXES.md` with critical fix documentation\n- **GitFlow Pattern:** Fully implemented with proper feature → develop → release workflow\n\nThe repository now has a complete GitFlow structure that addresses the critical production issue while establishing a safe, structured branching workflow for future development. The v1.0.0 release preparation can proceed safely with the protocol serialization fix included.",
