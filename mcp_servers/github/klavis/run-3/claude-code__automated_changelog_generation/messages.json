This workflow is configured to automatically trigger whenever the branch is updated, ensuring that a fresh Docker image is built for the latest code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Key Changes:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Added GitHub Actions Workflow:** A new workflow file (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` or similar) has been added.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Leverages GitHub Action Templates:** The workflow is based on existing GitHub Action templates for Docker image building, ensuring best practices and ease of maintenance.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Automated Trigger:** The workflow is set to run automatically on `push` events to the branch, providing continuous integration for Docker image creation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Benefits:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Continuous Integration:** Ensures that a Docker image is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Improved Reliability:** Catches build issues early in the development cycle.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Reduced Manual Effort:** Eliminates the need for manual Docker image builds.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*   **Faster Feedback Loop:** Developers get immediate feedback on the Docker build status of their changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**How to Test:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPush a new commit to this branch, and observe the GitHub Actions tab to confirm the workflow is triggered and completes successfully.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Related Issues:** NA\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n_This PR was originally from a fork: **QwertyJack/claude-code** (branch:
