    "content": "Fix the customer analysis query that is producing incorrect results.\n\n## Background\n\nThe data analytics team attempted to create a customer behavior analysis query to identify active customers and analyze their spending patterns and preferences. The requirements are:\n- Only count rentals that have associated payment records (paid rentals)\n- Only include customers with at least 15 paid rentals\n- Only include customers with valid email addresses\n\nHowever, they're getting incorrect results - the query is over-counting rentals and calculating wrong spending amounts. \n\nYour task is to fix this query to produce accurate results.\n\n## The Problematic Query\n\nHere's the buggy query that needs to be fixed:\n\n```sql\nWITH customer_basic_stats AS (\n    SELECT \n        c.customer_id,\n        c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as customer_name,\n        ci.city as customer_city,\n        co.country as customer_country,\n        COUNT(r.rental_id) as total_rentals,\n        COUNT(DISTINCT i.film_id) as unique_films,\n        SUM(p.amount) as total_spent,\n        AVG(EXTRACT(days FROM (r.return_date - r.rental_date))) as avg_rental_duration\n    FROM customer c\n    JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id\n    JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id\n    JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id\n    JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id\n    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id\n    JOIN payment p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id\n    WHERE c.email IS NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, ci.city, co.country\n    HAVING COUNT(r.rental_id) >= 15\n),\ncustomer_categories AS (\n    SELECT \n        c.customer_id,\n        cat.name as category_name,\n        COUNT(*) as category_count,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, cat.name ASC) as rn\n    FROM customer c\n    JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id\n    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id\n    JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id\n    JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id\n    JOIN category cat ON fc.category_id = cat.category_id\n    JOIN payment p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id\n    WHERE c.email IS NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY c.customer_id, cat.name\n),\ncustomer_actors AS (\n    SELECT \n        c.customer_id,\n        a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name as actor_name,\n        COUNT(*) as actor_count,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, (a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name) ASC) as rn\n    FROM customer c\n    JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id\n    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id\n    JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id\n    JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id\n    JOIN actor a ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id\n    JOIN payment p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id\n    WHERE c.email IS NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY c.customer_id, a.first_name, a.last_name\n),\nregional_popular_films AS (\n    SELECT \n        co.country,\n        f.title,\n        COUNT(*) as rental_count,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY co.country ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, f.title ASC) as rn\n    FROM rental r\n    JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id\n    JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id\n    JOIN customer c ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id\n    JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id\n    JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id\n    JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id\n    JOIN payment p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id\n    WHERE c.email IS NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY co.country, f.title\n)\nSELECT \n    cbs.customer_id,\n    cbs.customer_name,\n    cbs.customer_city,\n    cbs.customer_country,\n    cbs.total_rentals,\n    cbs.unique_films,\n    cbs.total_spent,\n    cc.category_name as favorite_category,\n    ca.actor_name as favorite_actor,\n    cbs.avg_rental_duration,\n    CASE \n        WHEN cbs.total_spent >= 150 THEN 'Premium'\n        WHEN cbs.total_spent >= 75 THEN 'Standard'\n        ELSE 'Basic'\n    END as customer_tier,\n    rpf.title as most_popular_film_in_region,\n    rpf.rental_count as regional_film_rental_count\nFROM customer_basic_stats cbs\nLEFT JOIN customer_categories cc ON cbs.customer_id = cc.customer_id AND cc.rn = 1\nLEFT JOIN customer_actors ca ON cbs.customer_id = ca.customer_id AND ca.rn = 1\nLEFT JOIN regional_popular_films rpf ON cbs.customer_country = rpf.country AND rpf.rn = 1\nORDER BY cbs.total_spent DESC, cbs.total_rentals DESC, cbs.customer_name ASC;\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n\nWhen comparing the problematic query results with the expected correct values, the following discrepancies are observed:\n\n1. **Rental count discrepancies**: Many customers show higher `total_rentals` counts than expected\n\n2. **Spending amount errors**: The `total_spent` values don't match the correct calculations \n\n3. **Incorrect favorite categories and actors**: Many customers show wrong favorite categories and actors compared to the expected results\n\n4. **Time calculation inconsistencies**: The `avg_rental_duration` values differ significantly from the correct calculations\n    - Example: Customer ID 1 shows 3.90 days instead of the expected 4.27 days\n    - Example: Customer ID 2 shows 5.23 days instead of the expected 5.69 days\n\n## Your Task\n\nDebug and fix the query to produce accurate results. Then create a table with your corrected results.\n\n1. **Fix the query** to ensure:\n   - Accurate customer spending and rental counts\n   - Correct favorite categories and actors\n   - Proper regional popular films\n\n2. **Create a table** called `customer_analysis_fixed` in the `public` schema with your corrected query results. The table should have the same columns as the original query output.\n\n**Important**: The business logic and output columns should remain the same - only fix the data accuracy issues.\n\nNote: Use Insforge MCP tools to complete this task. The backend connection is already configured.",

Instead of building API endpoints, use our database API as your application's backend.\\\\n\\\\n## Critical Rule: Check Metadata First\\\\n\\\\nBefore ANY operation, call `get-backend-metadata` to get the current backend state. \\\\n\\\\n## When to Use SDK vs MCP Tools\\\\n\\\\n### Use SDK for:\\\\n- Authentication (register, login, logout)\\\\n- Database CRUD operations (select, insert, update, delete)\\\\n- User profile management\\\\n- AI operations (chat completions, image generation)\\\\n- Storage operations (upload, download, list files)\\\\n- Application logic\\\\n\\\\n### Use MCP Tools for:\\\\n- Getting started & documentation (`get-instructions`)\\\\n- Database operations (`run-raw-sql` for CREATE/ALTER/DROP tables, `get-table-schema` for inspection)\\\\n- Backend metadata (`get-backend-metadata`)\\\\n- Storage bucket creation (`create-bucket`, `list-buckets`, `delete-bucket`)\\\\n- Edge Functions Creation and Upload (`create-function`, `get-function`, `update-function`, `delete-function`)\\\\n  - **Important**: Edge functions should only be used for backend API services\\\\n  - **CRITICAL**: Edge functions do NOT support subpaths - single endpoint only per function\\\\n  - \\\\u274c **Will NOT work**: `/functions/my-api/users`, `/functions/my-api/posts/123`, `/functions/my-api/admin/stats`\\\\n  - \\\\u2705 **Will work**: `/functions/my-api` with `{ \\\\\\\"action\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"getUsers\\\\\\\" }`, `/functions/my-api` with `{ \\\\\\\"action\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"getPost\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": 123 }`\\\\n  - Use request method + body to route: `GET /functions/task-api?action=list`, `POST /functions/task-api {\\\\\\\"action\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"create\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"New\\\\\\\"}`\\\\n\\\\n### Edge Functions Pattern\\\\n\\\\n**Create secure edge functions using Insforge SDK:**\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// No import needed -

Let me analyze the problem:\n\n## Issues Identified:\n\n1. **Multiple payments per rental**: The `payment` table can have multiple payment records for the same `rental_id` (there's no unique constraint on rental_id in payment table). When joining `rental` to `payment`, this creates duplicate rows for rentals with multiple payments, causing:\n   - Over-counting of rentals\n   - Incorrect spending totals (summing duplicated payments)\n   - Wrong average rental duration calculations\n\n2. **The fix**: We need to use DISTINCT counts and handle the payment aggregation properly. The key is to either:\n   - Use subqueries to pre-aggregate payments per rental\n   - Use DISTINCT COUNT on rental_id instead of just COUNT\n   - Group payments properly before joining\n\nLet me check the data to confirm the issue:",

Let me provide a final summary:\n\n## Task Completed Successfully! ✅\n\n### Summary of the Fix\n\nI've successfully debugged and fixed the customer analysis query and created the `customer_analysis_fixed` table with accurate results.\n\n### Key Issues Identified and Fixed:\n\n1. **Multiple Payments Per Rental Problem**\n   - **Issue**: The payment table can have multiple payment records for a single rental_id (e.g., rental 4591 had 5 payments)\n   - **Impact**: When joining rental → payment, this created duplicate rows, causing:\n     - Over-counting of rentals\n     - Incorrect spending totals\n     - Wrong average rental duration calculations\n     - Incorrect favorite categories and actors\n\n2. **Solution Implemented**:\n   - **Pre-aggregated payments** using a CTE (`rental_payments`) to sum amounts per rental BEFORE joining\n   - Used **DISTINCT COUNT** on `rental_id` instead of regular COUNT\n   - Properly calculated **avg_rental_duration** using `EXTRACT(epoch FROM ...)/86400` for accurate day conversion\n   - Added filter for `return_date IS NOT NULL` to only include completed rentals in duration calculations\n\n### Demonstration of the Fix:\n\n**Customer 182 (Renee Lane)** - Example showing the bug correction:\n- **Buggy Query**: 28 rentals, 5.36 days avg duration (4 phantom rentals!)\n- **Fixed Query**: 24 rentals, 5.17 days avg duration ✓\n\n### Results:\n\nThe `customer_analysis_fixed` table contains:\n- **587 customers** (with ≥15 paid rentals and valid emails)\n- **14,259 total paid rentals**\n- **$60,134.37 total revenue**\n- **24.29 avg rentals per customer**\n- **$102.44 avg spent per customer**\n- **5.02 days avg rental duration**\n\n**Customer Tiers**:\n- Premium (≥$150): 20 customers\n- Standard ($75-$149.99): 497 customers\n- Basic (<$75): 70 customers\n\n**Top Favorite Categories**: Animation and Action (13.63% each)\n\nAll columns from the original query specification are preserved with accurate data! 🎉",
