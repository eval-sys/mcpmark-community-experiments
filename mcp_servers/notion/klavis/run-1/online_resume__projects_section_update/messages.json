Create a new project entry called \"Zapier Dashboard Redesign\" with:\n   - Description: \"Led the complete redesign of Zapier's main dashboard, focusing on improved usability and modern design patterns. Implemented new navigation system and responsive layouts.\"\n   - Date: Start \"2024-01-01\", End \"2024-06-30\"\n   - Tags: Add the existing \"UI Design\" tag, and create a new tag \"Enterprise\" with purple color, then add both tags to this project\n   - Phone: Same as the phone number under the Contact section\n   - Url: Same as the personal website under the Contact section\n\n3. After the Projects database block, add the following blocks in sequence:\n   - A divider block\n   - A heading_2 block with text \"Current Focus\"\n   - A paragraph block with content that dynamically references:\n     - The highest skill level from your Skills database (find the skill with the highest Skill Level percentage)\n     - Incorporate this into the text: \"The Zapier Dashboard Redesign represents my most impactful recent work, leveraging my expertise in [highest skill name] ([skill level]%) to deliver enterprise-grade solutions that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality.\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
