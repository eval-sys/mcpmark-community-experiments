The FAQ toggle now contains exactly 2 pairs that would be in the left column (first two) and 2 pairs that would be in the right column (last two), maintaining the logical structure you requested.\n\nAll Q&A pairs are now properly structured within the FAQ toggle with consistent formatting and the additional question about session duration has been successfully added to complete the reorganization.",
